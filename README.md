## The Company

Consider a well-established company operating in the retail food sector. Presently they have around
several hundred thousand registered customers and serve almost one million consumers a year.
They sell products from 5 major categories: wines, rare meat products, exotic fruits, specially
prepared fish and sweet products. These can further be divided into gold and regular products. The
customers can order and acquire products through 3 sales channels: physical stores, catalogs and
company’s website. Globally, the company had solid revenues and a healthy bottom line in the past
3 years, but the profit growth perspectives for the next 3 years are not promising... For this reason,
several strategic initiatives are being considered to invert this situation. One is to improve the
performance of marketing activities, with a special focus on marketing campaigns.

## The marketing department

The marketing department was pressured to spend its annual budget more wisely. The CMO
perceives the importance of having a more quantitative approach when taking decisions, reason why
a small team of data scientists was hired with a clear objective in mind: to build a predictive model
which will support direct marketing initiatives. Desirably, the success of these activities will prove the
value of the approach and convince the more skeptical within the company.

## The data

The data set contains socio-demographic and firmographic features about 2.240 customers who
were contacted. Additionally, it contains a flag for those customers who responded the campaign,
by buying the product.
